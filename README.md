### Startup Marketing Timeline

The Startup Marketing Timeline (SMT) is a concept developed around the idea that marketing evolves as a startup progresses through it's lifetime. The tactics a mature startup use (such as Airbnb, Slack, or Uber) will be completely different to what they were using when they first started.

Unfortunatly most startups use the websites and marketing material of these websites as a starting point for designing their own early stage startup websites and material. However, these tactics are inefficent at converting users as users are not in the same "life stage" as the audiences looking at the matured startups material.

Here is a breakdown of life stages to audience-startup relationships:

1. **Todlers**: never heard of your product or concept before.
2. **Teenagers**: heard of your product from someone but still doesn't know exactly what it does.
3. **Adults**: knows what your product does and knows they will sign up before even hitting the website.
4. **Grand Parents**: constant organic recommendations and traffic.

The phase between converting your audience from teenagers to adults is called "coming of age" and is when there is a big change in focus of the marketing of a company. They no longer have to convince people of the benifits of their product as the audience have mostly been recommended the product by a friend to solve a certain problem they have and are already willing to sign up. In this case, they don't need marketing to convince them to sign up, they need to be given the easiest possible method of signing up instead. The marketing then changes from aquistion to engagement and maintaining.

When a startup has not come of age but is using tactics that mature startups use, it's like trying to convice a kids to drink a beer; it just doesn't work. Maybe they will taste the beer but it won't lead to regular use. They need to age and with aging, comes maturity of their taste buds and a higher degree of likelyness that they will just drink beer because everyone else does.
