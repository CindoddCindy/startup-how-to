- Build SEO
  - Create a large amount of use case website pages so when people search "How to make spaghetti with jam" your app appears
  - Use a standard layout for your pages, then you can automate the creation of the pages such as a Typeform to Webflow workflow. In this use case, someone fills in a Typeform with structured info and then on submitting, a new page is created under the appropriate topic. WebMerge does this well and has created a page for every integration they have. 
  - Create specific pages for your dynamic data (if your app has a public search function). This means your might want to create an actual page for "Rental Listings in Perth, Australia" rather than only having filters which get this result. This is good for SEO.
- Build your own audience
  - Create interesting and engaging articles on a blog or a blogging platform (such as Medium)
  - Build an audience before you even have a product by engaging them with interesting articles
  - Publicly post about development of your product - people are interested in how startups operate
  - Share content people are interested in such as the Landing Folio which is a simple idea of sharing cool landing pages
- Cold Emailing
  - Please do not spam people, they will ignore spam anyway
  - Send personalised emails to people in your target audience
  - Find them on linked in or on help forums or in online communities

  - Make sure you include screenshots or a video to engage users
  - Try using a gif for the main image
  - Make sure you post at the *optimal* Product Hunt posting time as each day is reset
- Post to Hacker News
  - Similar to reddit, do not be "markety" or you'll be shut down
  - Post to "Show HN:"
  - E.g. "Show HN: Rumblum - Tool for automating document creation with data from other apps"
- Post in social media groups
  - Facebook groups which have a tight community centered around your niche area
  - Twitter hashtags which people search for that are specific to your idea
- Comment on forums
  - Find forum discussions which discuss a problem which your product solves and comment at the end of them
  - E.g. when Zapier was starting, they would post at the bottom of forums discussing how to connect MailChimp to Google Sheets
- Sponsor GitHub repositories
  - Thousands of developers read over GitHub repositories which are mostly open source and developed for free
  - Try and see if you can pay a small amount of money to get onto their front page or "readme" file
- Leverage other platform's audiences
  - Airbnb listed all their properties on Craigslist and then redirected them to Airbnb to book

- Use your existing users to share the app
  - Get people to go through your app whenever possible
  - Rumblum generates custom documents, but when you send them in an email to a person, when you click the document, it opens the document in a preview window which looks native but is actually on the Rumblum app with the Rumblum logo down the bottom corner
  - When hotmail started, they appended the line “Get Your Free Email at Hotmail” to every email they delivered which skyrocketed the audience to over 1 million users in 6 months
- Preload a user's profile with example data
  - It is much easier for a user to get started with an app if they have an example
  - The example can help spark ideas for the user on how they might use the app
- Engage your users at the moment they most want you
  - Health Engine has partnered with health clinics so that as soon as a receptionist puts in your mobile number and name and sets you as "waiting for doctor", you recieve an SMS which lets you know you can "avoid the wait by booking on Health Engine"
- Get insights into features people want by looking at compeditor forums
